# 20 Newsgroups Classification

## Repository Structure

Main training/testing:
    `train.py` — trains the model and saves the best checkpoint
    `test.py` — evaluates the best model and saves metrics + plots
    `model.py` — BiLSTM encoder + word attention Top-K + cross-attention + classifier
    `data_pipeline.py` — dataset loading, sentence splitting, tokenization, vocabulary + GloVe loading
    `config.py` — all hyperparameters and file paths
    `best_model_by_val_loss.pt` — saved checkpoint based on best validation loss

Analysis (generated outputs saved to `attention_reports/`):
    `analysis-1.py` — attention visualization for examples like Top-K words, cross-attention heatmaps, and sentence importance.
    `analysis-2.py` — error analysis such as per-class metrics, confusion matrix, misclassified examples + plots
    `analysis-3.py` — effect of attention like Top-K sensitivity + entropy/statistics plots
    `analysis-4.py` — failure-mode analysis like biases + compounding error patterns

Outputs:
    `attention_reports/` — JSON summaries, CSVs, plots produced by analysis scripts
    `test_metrics.csv`, `confusion_matrix_test.csv`, and various `.png` plots — generated by `test.py`
